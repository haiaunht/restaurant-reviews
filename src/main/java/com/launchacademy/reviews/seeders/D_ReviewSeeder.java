This place caught our eye because of the name so we figured we'd try it out. As soon as we walked in you can see the cleanliness of the place and smell the food. People were very kind and got us seated right away. Not a huge menu and that's what I like. If you've got a big menu then you have to say to yourself that they ain't making all that stuff from scratch. Our experience was an excellent one as the server was always checking to see if we needed anything and was very prompt with our requests. Food was delicious!  I know I ordered enchiladas, which is pretty plain for a Mexican restaurant, but the flavor was perfect especially with that salsa verde. Chips and salsa was good and also came with a pico de gallo that had nopales (cactus). I would go back to this place just because. Highly recommend it.");

Maybe could have used a little more sauce so it wouldn't be too dry, but the flavor of the meat was great. Kalua pork was also very tasty. Not dry at all and the cabbage had soaked in all the juices.
